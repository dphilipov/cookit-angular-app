<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![App Screen Shot][app-screenshot]

Cookit is a digital cookbook that allows you to create new recipes, browse through all existing recipes and to generate a shopping list with all ingredients necessary for the recipes that you want to cook.

## Key Features

* A **Guest view**, with limited interaction and a **Logged in view** with full functionality
* Logged in users can: 
    * **Create** new recipes
    * **Generate a Shopping List** which calculates the necessary ingredients to buy
    * **Delete** or **Edit** any recipe they have created 
    * Access their **Profile** page, which shows their latest created recipes
* Client-side **Routing** via **Angular Router**

The website uses Appwrite (a self-hosted Firebase alternative) for Authentication, Database and Storage. 

Architecturally, modules are split into *core* & *shared* with different folders for each components. Services related to **Authentication** and **Fetching data** are kept separate and imported when necessary.
